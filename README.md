   6. IOT
      
ADVANTAGES OF JAVA:

Java language and APIs --> font-end communication.
Java Virtual Machine --> back-end communication.

1. Java API:
   Java language defines syntax for Java programming language, basic rules and vocabulary to write algorithms.
   APIs are pre-written programs in java to provide extra functionality to our own code.
   Use of APIs and Java libraries are used in typical java program.
2. Java Virtual Machine:
   Its a Java code compiler, where java file is first compiled to bytecode.
   these java bytecode can only run in JVM machines.
   So the JVM interprets the bytecode to the OS(like windows..)
   additional abstrsaction layer between java platform and the underlying machine hardware.
